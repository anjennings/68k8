only one guy has really got linux to run on a 68k8
you need as much RAM as possible to run linux (960k+)

TTL is way to much of a pain and lacks resolution
IDK what peripherals I really want (MC68681 seems nice, DART, IO, Timers)

Programmable logic chips are going to be required
A19 - A16, RS, DS, 
ROM_EN, IO_EN x ???, RAM_EN x 2

using full 68k would require burning 2 different roms so ill stick with the 68008

also

Maybe run FUZIX???

SD Card breakout with ATMEGA328P? (UART 2 UART?)


ATF16V8BQL
what kind of clock does this thing use?

MC68B50
	Single UART
	Up to 1 Mbps
	Couple extra output lines but not much else
	
MC68901
	Multifunction Peripheral
	4 Timers
	1 USART
	8 GPIO Pins
	Basically a 16550 + CTC + 1/2 PIO
	
MC68681
	DUART Controller
	2 UART
	1 Timer
	6 Bit Input Port
	8 Bit Output Port
	
ATMEGAXX 
	UART
	SPI for SD Card
